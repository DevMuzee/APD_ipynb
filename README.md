- Predictive Analytics: Use historical trends to predict call surges.
- Community Outreach: Educate the public on mental health support resources.
- Improve Data Quality: Ensure unique incident IDs and refine issue tagging.
- Tech Upgrades: Leverage AI for smart dispatching and real-time alerts.
- Specialized Units: Establish dedicated teams for mental health-related calls.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Limitations
- Missing Data: Imputation may have affected accuracy.
- No Real-Time Integration: Focused only on past data.
- Inconsistent Tagging: Mental health tags lacked uniformity.
- Duplicate Incident Numbers: Not reliable for unique indexing.

## 📌 Conclusion
This project reveals essential opportunities to enhance emergency response services. 
By analyzing call volumes, response times, officer performance, and mental health trends, strategic improvements can be made to ensure public safety,
reduce response delays, and address mental health-related emergencies more effectively.
